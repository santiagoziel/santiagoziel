# Hi there! üëã
I'm a Python/Typescript Developer based in Mexico, with three years of experience in back-end development. I specialize in using the Flask and Express frameworks to build powerful, reliable web applications, and I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality work for a wide range of clients.

Some of my notable projects include:

- Data scraping and automatic report generation using SQL databases
- Designing and implementing microservice architectures with Rabbitmq
- Developing web applications on the Cardano Blockchain with the Blockfrost API
- Implementation and publishing of APIs with corresponding SDKs to public and private npm registries.
- Deploying containerized services with Docker and Docker Compose
- Automating releases with GitHub Actions

In my free time, I love playing Magic: The Gathering and dancing. You can find more information about me [on my website](https://santiagotorres.online/) and check out my [resume](https://santiagotorres.online/curriculum) to see a full list of my skills and experience.
